This project demonstrates how to perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on a dataset of mall customers. The goal is to identify distinct groups of customers based on their purchasing behavior.

Dataset:

The dataset Mall_Customer.csv should have the following columns:

1. Annual_Spend: The annual amount spent by the customer.
2. Frequency_of_Purchase: The frequency of purchases made by the customer.
3. Average_Purchase_Value: The average value of each purchase.
Ensure your dataset is in the correct format before running the script.
